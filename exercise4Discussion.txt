Server resources for running jobs should be kept below a certain threshold such as 80/90%

Priority on jobs, so higher ones get processed sooner 
	Possibly on less busy servers
	
A job should record its progress so it can easily be restarted elsewhere in the result of a failure

Failover for the distributing system

Errors are assigned against a job and the progress is also remembered. 
A failure should not stop other jobs executing with those resources

In the result of a full server failure all job progress will have been saved and there are 2 scenarios
	Have backup servers for when a failure happens
	Give the jobs prority so that they are executed first
