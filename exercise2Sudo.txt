Inserting data:

Check the size of the current database
If the remaining size is lower than that of the current record to enter
	create a unique identifier based off the database name, table name and record id
	Create a new database and table for that record then insert the record
else
	create a unique identifier based off the database name, table name and record id
	Add the data to the existing database
end

Discussion on DB structure:

Depending on the design of the databases and how the grouping of data the following models could be used:
	Enter any data in to the first accessible database
	Have a database that covers a certain grouping of tables, such as a DB for product info (pricing, names, information) and another for personal info (name, address, bank details)
	Have a separate database for each table (probably a bad idea because most tables won't have enough information to fill the 1GB limit)

Obtaining data using identifier:

Locate the database using the identifier
Locate the table using the identifier
Locate the record using the identifier

Obtaining data using search criteria (table(s) will be specified):	

Obtain all identifiers from all databases for the given table(s)
cycle through the data to obtain the required information matching the other search criteria
